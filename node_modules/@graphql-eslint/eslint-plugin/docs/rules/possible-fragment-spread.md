# `possible-fragment-spread`

✅ The `"extends": "plugin:@graphql-eslint/operations-recommended"` property in a configuration file enables this rule.

- Category: `Operations`
- Rule name: `@graphql-eslint/possible-fragment-spread`
- Requires GraphQL Schema: `true` [ℹ️](../../README.md#extended-linting-rules-with-graphql-schema)
- Requires GraphQL Operations: `false` [ℹ️](../../README.md#extended-linting-rules-with-siblings-operations)

A fragment spread is only valid if the type condition could ever possibly be true: if there is a non-empty intersection of the possible parent types, and possible types which pass the type condition.

> This rule is a wrapper around a `graphql-js` validation function.
