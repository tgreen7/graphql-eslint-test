## Available Rules

Each rule has emojis denoting:

- ðŸš€ `graphql-eslint` rule
- ðŸ”® `graphql-js` rule
- ðŸ”§ if some problems reported by the rule are automatically fixable by the `--fix` [command line](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems) option
- ðŸ’¡ if some problems reported by the rule are manually fixable by editor [suggestions](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-rules#providing-suggestions)

<!-- ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT! Do not manually modify this table. Run: `yarn generate:docs` -->
